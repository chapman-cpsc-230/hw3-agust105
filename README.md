**Author:** Francis Agustin

**Due date:** March 11, 2016

## Description

* Completed exercises 2.17 and 2.18 from the text (boolean expressions, loops)
* Used 'for' loops with turtle.py to write program that can draw shapes


## What I Learned from This

I learned a lot more about ‘for’ loops and how they can be used to perform a variety of tasks much easier than a ‘while’ loop. Also practiced with boolean statements.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
